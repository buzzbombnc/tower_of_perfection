                <p>This website is a place for me to write about technology, show off various projects and keep my writing skills sharp.
                Perhaps I'll complain about politics, add recipes, or talk personal finance as well!  We shall see.</p>
                <p>My longer term plans are to continue updating the site in general, including the software, design and anything else 
                that strikes my fancy.</p>
                <p>As for the name, it is a smart ass reply to the oh-so-corporate term "center of excellence".  If you've ever been 
                stuck in Corporate America and heard that term, you know exactly why the term is a joke!</p>

                <p>My name is Ken Treadway.  I am a systems engineer that writes in various computer languages and a little bit of
                english as well.  I've been in the computing industry for over 18 years and will likely continue to play with things
                until I keel over.</p>
